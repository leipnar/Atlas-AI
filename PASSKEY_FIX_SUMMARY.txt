PASSKEY IMPLEMENTATION - FIX SUMMARY
====================================

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. User model missing passkey credential storage
2. Backend only has placeholder/simulated passkey functions
3. Missing @simplewebauthn/server dependency
4. Frontend calls non-functional backend endpoints

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Updated User model with passkeyCredentials and currentChallenge fields
2. ⏳ Need to install: npm install @simplewebauthn/server@^9.0.0
3. ⏳ Need to implement full WebAuthn flow in auth.controller.ts
4. ⏳ Need to update auth.routes.ts with proper endpoints
5. ⏳ Need to update frontend API service calls
6. ⏳ Need to update Account Settings component
7. ⏳ Need to update Login Page component

NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE:
1. Install dependencies in backend directory
2. Replace auth controller passkey functions with full implementation
3. Update route endpoints
4. Update frontend service calls
5. Test registration and login flows

The full implementation code is ready to be applied following
the WebAuthn standard using SimpleWebAuthn library.
